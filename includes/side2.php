  <h3><a href="#">Looking forward </a></h3>
  <p><img src="images/dance.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="194" />In Unique Blossom Schools, it is never too early to prepare  for the future and as such, we are already looking forward to an eventful  2016/2017 session. Exceeding the expectations of our parents has always been  one of our greatest motivations and from the testimonies of some of our  parents, we have done just that in 2015/2016 session. We can only promise to  keep improving on our prowess as we strive to carve innovative and God fearing leaders out of  our wards, pupils and students</p>
