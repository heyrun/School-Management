              <h1>Our School</h1>
          
              <p class="border">The Unique Blossom Schools         started off with the Crèche section in the year 2003 in Area 3,         Abuja. It later moved to its permanent site  on the 8th of May 2007. The new site is at Plot 2251, Tangayika Street, off IBB         Boulevard off Gwarara Street, behind Indian High Commission, Maitama-Abuja.<br />
              The school is financed, run and managed by a group of people i.e. the         Board of governors headed by Mr. Olusegun B. Olubo and the Director/Proprietress         in the person of Mrs B.B Olubo.</p>
<p class="border">The School is daily supervised by the Management Team,         Representative (the coordinator) and a team of sectional heads. This Team ensures that members of the academic staff         discharge their duties promptly. They also look into training  and         retraining of staffs via Workshops, Seminars, on the job training and attending         part-time courses in various  institutions across the country.</p>
<p class="border">Service delivery is one of the things we can't and don't         compromise, hence the need for updating our records and curriculum via         research project, internet exploration, brainstorming sessions and deeper         study habits.<br />
  The school is divided into sections for effectiveness.         These sections are supervised by sectional heads.<br />
        The sections in the school are:</p>
<p class="border">
<ul>
  <li>Crèche (age 0-1)</li>
  <li>Reception (age 1-2)</li>
  <li>Pre nursery (age 2-3)</li>
  <li>Nursery One (age 3-4)</li>
  <li>Nusery Two (age 4-5)</li>
  <li>Primary One - Six (age 6-12)</li>
</ul></p>
<p class="border">Bus Service: the school runs bus service for pupils of         the school. The prinicipal's aim is to serve parents better knowing they         have very tight schedules. Our drivers and bus pilots are mannered and dedicated         to work. The buses have tracking device for better monitoring.<br />
        Service lines - the school on her part ensures a very cordial relationship         with its clients. They are contacted on phone when the need arises. The         school also entertain calls from her clients </p>
