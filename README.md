# School-Management

This repo is a school management portal built on vanilla PHP/MySQL. The site was originally built in 2014 for Unique Blossom Schools, Abuja, Nigeria. 

Teachers can upload/populate student's attendance, test scores and exam scores. Entries can be updated or deleted before the term ends. after the end of each term, commmited records cannot be edited anymore. 
Students report cards are automatically created. 
Parents that log in can only see information about their kids. They can view Teachers' comments, attends log, payment history and digital report sheets of their kids. 
Parents can leave comments for their teachers for each kid. 
Registration of new students are done on the site, including assigning students to classes, subjects and other curricular activities. 
The site also has other non-dynamic pages like the staff profile, about page, contact, clubs, etc.
